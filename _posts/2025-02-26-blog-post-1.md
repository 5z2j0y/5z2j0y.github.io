「春霞や ，喉渇きけり ， 待つ身なり」

Today is the **third day** of the semester. So far, sticking to the plan I made two days ago is going relatively smoothly, though it might just be because there are fewer classes in the first week, lol.

I've analyzed my usage patterns for web-based AI: 

1) *Brainstorming* ideas; 

2) Creating pipelines based on those ideas. 

For programming, I mainly rely on **Copilot integrated in VSCode**. While the workflow is clear, it shows I'm not using AI effectively for research. I hope to develop my information-seeking skills using grok-deepsearch.

Yesterday, our team leader held a meeting in the library's discussion room about the "**Power Line Inspection Drone**" project. I was particularly nervous when speaking and probably came across as socially anxious... Plus, the team is all girls... *quite awkward*.

I proposed two points: 

1) Using **SAM** for open-world damage detection; 

2) Using *pose estimation* for precise tower positioning. 

I believe power towers look similar everywhere, and current RFID only locates entire towers without pinpointing specific components (like insulators, conductors, etc.). This could potentially lead to a published paper.

Unfortunately, I'm **not familiar with SLAM**, which almost led to an embarrassing moment. I haven't figured out how to process depth camera video streams, especially combining them with RGB footage for inference. Besides, as undergraduates, we probably don't have permission to film actual towers with drones in the real world anyway.
