「荒れし海 ，波に飲まれそう ， 秋の夜」

Just writing a blog post to prove I'm still alive~

I must say, I've lost that beginning-of-semester motivation, especially with more and more courses, plus lab work.

The professor of the LLM project seems to have high expectations of me, particularly now that my talented roommate has also joined, which makes me feel a lot of pressure.

Nevertheless, I cherish this opportunity because I feel this professor has a forward-thinking vision, is willing to explore new things, is responsible toward me, and has already helped write two recommendation letters.

Well. I still don't feel like blogging. After the research project application is completed, I'll need to adjust my state of mind.
