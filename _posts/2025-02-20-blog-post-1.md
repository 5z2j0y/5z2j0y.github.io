「薄氷解け ,  筒影静かに ,  指の春光」

It's been a while since I last wrote a blog. 🌱

Thinking about the *improvements* I wrote down in anger five days ago makes me want to laugh now. I ambitiously asked GPT for so many ideas, but in the end, I still relied on the **YOLO-pose** model.

I did try to build my own model, using *YOLO11* as the backbone network and hastily writing a convolutional regression head. I was speechless when I saw the total parameters were only **1.5Mb**. 😅

The consequence of forcing the training was that while the loss seemed to decrease quickly, the inference was a mess. 

At least the purpose was achieved. The impact feels quite significant - after learning for so long, I *still* couldn't design a good model.

Oh, and there's another interesting thing - if you expand the **Yolo-box** cropping area outward by *5 pixels* for Yolo-pose keypoint detection, the results are much better! ✨
