「落葉舞い , 道は続くよ ,  影 寄り添う」

These days my mood has been *terrible*. Or perhaps I'm just not mature enough. I don't want to talk about it.

This is my new reading note. This author's writing isn't good - the pace is *too fast* and the content **lacks depth**. For example, with RAG, he simply crawled web pages and used regex to extract sentences as context for GPT input, and called it "RAG".

But I must admit my own limitations. This book does provide a *comprehensive* introduction to various NLP techniques, even covering Vision Transformers, so I have to read it.

I've uploaded my notes to [GitHub](https://github.com/5z2j0y/Reading-Notes/tree/main/Transformers-for-NLP-and-CV)

So much frustration bottled up inside - that's what being an **adult** means, I suppose. Maybe I'll just express it through a haiku about scenery. It *hurts*, but I can't cry out loud.
