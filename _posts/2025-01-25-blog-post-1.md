# **Winter Break Study Plan** üìö

Six days of winter break have passed, but I've wasted quite a bit of time. For instance, I spent too much time trying to implement traditional computer vision algorithms for test tube liquid level detection without success, and I'm still struggling with ROS2 syntax.

Take the detection of liquid levels in test tubes for example - **simply applying YOLO isn't always the best solution**. Today, I found a paper about adjusting model attention using ROI, which significantly improved the detection of contents in glass apparatus. This shows that when we can't solve a vision problem, it's not always about spending more time, but rather about lacking knowledge of new algorithms.

Therefore, I need to focus on learning new concepts going forward, aiming to understand *one algorithm per day* üí°. **Transformer** will be my main focus with daily study sessions, while GAN networks can be a side interest for spare time.

From now on, I will:
- *Document each new computer vision algorithm I learn in my blog* 
- *Update my GitHub notes daily* for both books I'm reading:
  - "How to Build a Large Language Model from Scratch" 
  - "Deep Learning for Vision Systems"

And importantly - **no more War Thunder gaming!!!** üéÆ‚ùå
