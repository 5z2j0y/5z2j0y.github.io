「春嵐や ，土に残るは ， 冬の熱」

After using grok3-deepsearch, my learning efficiency has **greatly improved**. I no longer need to spend time searching for papers - by prompting grok to "research," I can get perfect answers. The research skills I was lacking have been quickly supplemented by grok, though perhaps with insufficient depth. This inevitably makes one wonder: in the future, will it truly be possible to *"purchase"* knowledge, skills, or even wisdom? 🤔

The first week of the semester has already passed, and it's been extremely busy. Compared to my roommate, I need to complete more than **twice the number of credits**! Getting up early every day is definitely making me tired (I even bought an eye mask to help me sleep earlier). I think my choice not to go to the lab was wise - when things are quiet, I can think more deeply about problem-solving pipelines.

These days I've been trying some zero-shot CV projects, like *Depth Anything* and *Segment Anything*. I've discovered that zero-shot approaches might not necessarily solve downstream problems. For example, I originally wanted to use SAM to segment cracks, but SAM would divide the workpiece into two halves based on the crack. I'm considering few-shot solutions or approaches combining ViT.

While using Depth Anything, I had a sudden inspiration: since there are many existing RGB datasets, if I could generate depth datasets from RGB datasets, I could quickly train on depth images and even propose new models. Compared to RGB images, such data contains depth information and might better solve certain problems.

This blog post was written during a rare moment of free time. Recently, I've had exhausting metalworking internships every week - when I return to the dorm, my **body feels completely drained** and all I want to do is shower and sleep. 😴 Things should return to a state slightly more relaxed than last semester by mid-April. I must say, the metalworking internship provides good time for thinking. After all, while waiting in line for processing, I can peacefully think about problems and chat with grok3.
