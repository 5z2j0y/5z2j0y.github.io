「南の雪を恋しく思いながら、騒がしい冷たい雨が心に染みる」

OpenAI launched its **"O3-mini-mini"** mode, but as a free user, the experience is even worse than **Gemini-2.0-flash** 😠

DeepSeek's servers have been crashing for five consecutive days since January 26, which made me realize that the **Gemini API** is so effective that I can't even use up its daily quota 😂. I was considering paying to support a domestic service, but I'll keep observing for a while.

Back to the main point, I read a book titled **"Understanding AIGC in One Book"**; my reading notes are available in my GitHub repository: [Reading Notes](https://github.com/5z2j0y/Reading-Notes/blob/main/Light-Reading/Get-to-Know-AIGC.md). The book has a bit of a clickbait feel, but its table of contents and structure are quite impressive.

Most importantly, it taught me two things:
1. Image generation relies on **CLIP + Diffusion**, not on ViT.
2. The **VAE + GAN** approach remains favored for speed, especially in areas like special effects.

I believe that in the AIGC era, our main task has shifted from "creation" to **"review"**. This not only secures a steady demand for professionals but also indicates that technical skills are devaluing, leading to reduced demand for technicians. As long as we stay far ahead in AIGC applications and professional judgment, we won't be left behind.🚀
