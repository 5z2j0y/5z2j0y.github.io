- **Current Problems**:

    1. Insufficient robustness in instrument recognition, sensitive to occlusion and background

    2. Still haven't solved the interaction between gestures and instruments, still relying on feature engineering

- **Solutions**:

    1. Utilize temporal information:
    - Feed CNN feature vectors into LSTM to learn temporal information and instrument movements
    - 3D CNN: Input 8 consecutive frames into CNN to learn temporal information
    - Video transformer: Introduce spatio-temporal attention

    2. Utilize mediapipe gesture information:
    - Concatenate hand keypoints with video frame CNN feature vectors as input to LSTM
    - Use hand information as context input to the model
    - Add ROI around hand areas to suppress background information

- **Can we directly apply mediapipe?**

    1. Define keypoints for measuring cylinders, beakers, and volumetric flasks
    2. Perform keypoint annotation
    3. Implement keypoint detection
