「冬雨や, ひるの陽射しに雲戻る, 鴉の羽」

Finally, I rushed through the book "Build a Large Language Model from Scratch" 📚. Yes, DeepSeek's API service is still down, lmao 😅

The most important task now is to get a project from my professor, so I'm putting **LLM** aside for now. I plan to work on an acoustic *GAN* project (like _wavenet_) and a visual *StyleGAN* project in the next three days ⏳. If time permits, I'll read some popular science articles about **CLIP**. The priority is to satisfy my professor first, then continue my LLM journey 🎯.

If you're reading this, please give my project a star at [![Reading Notes](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/5z2j0y/Reading-Notes?style=social)](https://github.com/5z2j0y/Reading-Notes) ⭐

GitHub Traffic identifies GitHub Desktop as a Unique Visitor - I thought someone was actually viewing my project. What a sad story 😢

Learning **Transformer** is like playing "_Escape from Tarkov_" - you're either a loot-loving *Scav* or a killing machine *PMC*. I'm still too noob at this. If only there was a magic spell like "**Let's think step by step**"... 🧙‍♂️
