「秋風や ， 枯葉舞う音 ， 空寂し」

Today I came across a rather depressing statement: *"Anyone with an AI platform account and a credit card can compete with AI experts"*. 😔 Hugging Face's AutoTrain and Google's AutoML have already proven their capabilities. When Transformers fully understand wandb one day, four years of university education might become meaningless.

Before automated training becomes widespread, perhaps I could make a living as an "AI platform customer service representative". Or maybe things aren't quite so gloomy after all. ✨

I'm concerned about whether the future lies in customizing models for clients (perhaps what AI platforms hope for profit) or simply selecting existing models, given that Hugging Face already hosts plenty of specialized models, not to mention cost and environmental considerations. 🤔

On another note, could open-world models become mainstream? While they demand more edge computing power, they could save substantial data collection and training costs. **But that's quite a trade-off!**

However, in fixed scenarios like autonomous driving, there's almost no need for open-world capabilities. Open-world approaches might not be as reliable in terms of accuracy, stability, and explainability.

I'm uncertain about future career paths. Perhaps new model development and pre-training will be controlled by a few major companies. When their fierce competition subsides, they might start exploiting downstream service providers and users through their market power, and technological progress could stagnate. 💭

Why so melancholic today? Because school starts tomorrow! *I really don't want to wake up early...* 😪
