「春陽や ，薄霞街に ， 朧雨」

Today marks the **first day** of the new semester. Fortunately, there aren't many classes in the first week.

This semester I have around *33 credits*, which is lighter compared to last semester's 37.

Sadly, only 20 credits are from sophomore courses, as I need to make up for freshman courses I missed due to changing majors.

What's frustrating is that despite completing College Physics B (Part 1) last semester, I now have to take College Physics C from scratch.

Looking on the bright side, this means there's a lot of overlapping content that could help "boost" my GPA.

My goals for this semester:
1. **Early to bed, early to rise** - in bed by 11:30 PM, up at 7:10 AM on class days, 7:30 AM on non-class days, and 8:00 AM on weekends. *Must eat breakfast*.
2. **No skipping classes**. If I don't like a professor, I'll attend physically but follow online lectures, ensuring participation points and avoiding laziness in the dorm.
3. *Review and summarize* after completing each unit, don't wait until the week before exams to start reviewing.
4. Use the Pomodoro Technique to plan study content, and set limits on leisure activities like watching videos.
5. Prioritize academics. Keep research work application-focused, take on projects like a mercenary, don't invest too much emotion or energy.

As an undergraduate, you can only do so much with applications anyway, and it's still easy to be replaced. Better to **focus on grades first**, secure a chance for postgraduate recommendation, and consider other things after having that safety net.
