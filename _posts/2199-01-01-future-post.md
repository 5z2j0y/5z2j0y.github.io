「诞生して、すみません」

I'm quite interested in Auto ML recently. It's strange that this approach hasn't become widespread in China, otherwise **impotent people** like me would all be unemployed lmao 🤖

Ever since I started working in computer vision, I've always been given *weird requirements* by others. For example, detecting whether the "spouts" of two beakers are aligned on a low-resolution camera. 😅 Am I just not good enough, or is the world too strange?

The more I learn about ML, the more I realize how **inadequate** I am. Sometimes I wish I was born ten years earlier. Now every interesting project has been patented, and my skills aren't good enough to propose new algorithms without focusing on applications. It's emo time now. 😢

I hope AI takes over humanity soon. *Born as a human, I'm sorry*. 🤷‍♂️
