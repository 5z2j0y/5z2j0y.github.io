「雪もないのに寒いものだな、滝の飛沫よ近づかないで」

First of all, **happy birthday** to myself! 🎂🎉

Many friends and seniors sent their wishes (seems like *nobody would know* without my QQ post QwQ). Haven't had time to reply to everyone, but *thank you all so much*!

Had a **strawberry-mango ice cream cake** last night, and *inevitably* got an upset stomach today 🥺

Haven't updated my code for quite a while. Been focusing on *reading* lately - I've put my reading notes on GitHub: https://github.com/5z2j0y/Reading-Notes. Feel free to learn and discuss together! This also helps keep me *accountable* for daily reading and updates!

War Thunder's *evil* new **Spring Festival** event is here again. Once I win that event vehicle, I'm *definitely* stopping 💰

Wonder how many more birthdays I'll have before **AI** takes over the Earth? 😟
