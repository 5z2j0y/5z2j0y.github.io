It's been so long I haven't written anything. Perhaps I was both lazy and busy. 
I pill up a lot of things to write about.

I think I am very aggressive and sharp guy, which either makes others repsect me or hate me.

When I am much more skilled than others, they will respect me, but when I am not, they will hate me.

That's why I am always trying to be the best, so that I can be respected.

It's very Weird, but as a low-EQ person, I don't think I can change this. So the only way is to be the best.

It's at the end of this semester, and I must make my best to have higher GPA to be recommended to USTC, my dream school.

And I don't think I would be respected any more if I don't get into USTC. So I am really nervous.

I must change from lazy and busy to buzy and productive.
