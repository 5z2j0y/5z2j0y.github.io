for a week, I made it to get up early and study in the lab. getting up early is surely productive.

a bloody experience is that DONOT join a group which the leader is not my trustful friend -- or you work much but will never get a good rank -- because the leader himself also have good friends in his group.

these days have much less class than last month. I really enjoy studying by myself without a teacher noisy around.
