Hey there! 👋 I'm **Xiong Liyan** (熊立言), a tech enthusiast and sophomore majoring in **Intelligent Science and Technology** at **Hefei University of Technology**. Let me share my story with you!

## Plot Twist: From Mechanical to AI! 🎭

Remember those movies where the main character has a life-changing revelation? Well, that's basically my story! 

* **Chapter 1**: Started in **Mechanical Engineering** (yes, I was all about nuts and bolts! 🔧)
* **Chapter 2**: Had my "aha!" moment with **computer vision** (turns out machines can see - mind blown! 🤯)
* **Chapter 3**: Joined the **Computer Vision Group** and never looked back

## The Great Switch 🔄

The transition wasn't just a random decision - it was more like falling in love! Here's what happened:

* Found myself spending more time with **algorithms** than with gears
* Got inspired by amazing seniors in the vision group (they're the real MVPs! 🏆)
* Transferred to **Intelligent Science** department (best plot twist ever!)
* Discovered my true passion in **AI**, especially after that mind-bending **Artificial Intelligence** course

## Cross-Pollinating Ideas 🌸

You know what's cooler than just AI? Mixing it with everything else! 

* Teamed up with **Materials Science** folks for some crazy experiments
* Combined **AI** with **Chemistry** (because why not make Chemistry even more explosive? 💥)
* Discovered that the best ideas often come from **unexpected combinations**

## The Professor Dream ✨

Picture this: me, in a cozy campus villa, surrounded by research papers and curious students...

* Fell in love with academia during a visit to **Westlake University**
* Got starstruck by their futuristic academic ring (seriously, it's like stepping into 2050!)
* Currently geeking out over:
  * **Multi-modal fusion networks**
  * **Conv+Transformer** architectures
  * **BiRNNs** and their endless possibilities

## Life Beyond Code 🎯

Because even AI enthusiasts need to touch grass sometimes!

* Fitness fanatic 💪
* Running enthusiast 🏃‍♂️
* English book worm 📚
* Dreamer of tech-powered futures 🚀

## The Bottom Line 📌

I'm just a guy who believes **AI** and **computer vision** can change the world, one pixel at a time! Whether it's building models, crafting vision systems, or dreaming up the next big tech breakthrough, I'm all in!
