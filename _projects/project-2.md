# Project Description
Designed and built an intelligent sorting trash bin as a competition entry for the 2025 Chinese College Engineering Practice and Innovation Competition. The system utilizes YOLO11 for waste classification, deployed on Raspberry Pi 4B in ONNX format. Through serial communication, the Raspberry Pi controls Arduino Mega and a serial display screen, managing servos for automated waste sorting while displaying real-time classification results.
