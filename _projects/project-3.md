# Project Description
This project aims to spark students' interest through common plants in daily life and introduce more basic knowledge about plants, such as leaf margins and leaf tips. Focusing on plants in the southern Anhui region, students can apply the knowledge they learn to the plants around them. Through programmatic source code, students can better understand the distribution of plants on the map, aligning with the original intention of the plant map teaching system.
